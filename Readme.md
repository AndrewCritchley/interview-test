# ShoppaTec Importer

## Scenario
We are ShoppaTec. We provide a white labelled solution for organisations to sell their products to users.
We are importing users and their associated organisations and need you to implement the core part of this importer.

## Business Rules

- If the user doesn't exist, then we add them.
- If the organisation doesn't exist then we add it.
- We then need to associate the user to the organisation if they are not already associated to that organisation.

## Notes
- The main focus of this test is to see how you understand and approach a problem. We don't expect you to finish the test as such.
